goldapsearch  
Not to be confused with GOLD apsearch, this is GO LDAPSEARCH

This tool is intended to simplify searching LDAP for various objects.   
Using ldapsearch is somewhat of a drag and I was hoping to provide a tool  
for those so inclined to perform raw ldapsearches that isnt a complete nightmare to use.


Future features:   
- Search and list specific types of objects
- Allow for adding, deleting, and modification of existing LDAP entries
- Prompt for user password rather than store in code and read in environment variable containing creds
- Support ldaps and ldap
- Support different bind types, Simple Bind, GSSAPI, and SASL
- Supporting dumping the entire database
- Potentially support BloodHound(Need to look into this more)
